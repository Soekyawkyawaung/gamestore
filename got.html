		<pre><font color="white">
In the late 13th century, the Mongol empire has laid waste to entire nations along 
their campaign to conquer the East. Tsushima Island is all that stands between mainland 
Japan and a massive Mongol invasion fleet led by the ruthless and cunning general, Khotun Khan.
As the island burns in the wake of the first wave of the Mongol assault, samurai warrior 
Jin Sakai stands as one of the last surviving members of his clan. He is resolved do whatever 
it takes, at any cost, to protect his people and reclaim his home. He must set aside the 
 traditions that have shaped him as a warrior to forge a new path, the path of the Ghost,
 and wage an unconventional war for the freedom of Tsushima.

 • In War-Torn Tsushima, Ancient Beauty Endures: In this open-world action adventure, you’ll roam 
 vast countrysides and expansive terrain to encounter rich characters, discover ancient landmarks,
 and uncover the hidden beauty of Tsushima.

• The Rise of the Ghost: In his quest to reclaim Tsushima, Jin must seek support from old friends 
and new unlikely allies. He must break away from tradition, become a new kind of warrior, and 
protect what’s left of his home at all costs.
• Mud, Blood, and Steel: Challenge opponents with your katana for an immersive samurai combat
experience, master the bow to eliminate distant threats, and develop stealth tactics to disorient 
and ambush enemies with surprise attacks.
